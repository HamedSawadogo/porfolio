              Hello! My name is Hamed and I enjoy creating things that live on
              the internet. My interest in web development started back in 2012
              when I decided to try editing custom Tumblr themes â€” turns out
              hacking together a custom reblog button taught me a lot about HTML
              & CSS! Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of
              working at an advertising agency, a start-up, a huge corporation,
              and a student-led design studio. My main focus these days is
              building accessible, inclusive products and digital experiences at
              Upstatement for a variety of clients. I also recently launched a
              course that covers everything you need to build a web app with the
              Spotify API using Node
            </TextWrapper>

          <div className="about-right">
